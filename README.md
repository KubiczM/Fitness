Fitness Program

"Fitness" is an application created in Python that will help you take care of your health and physical fitness. 
The program collects data from the user and provides personalized information regarding diet and exercises, 
helping to achieve the desired goals.


Features:

1. Calorie Calculation
   Based on the parameters provided by the user (age, weight, height, activity level), the application calculates:
   -> Calorie Deficit (for those aiming to lose weight),
   -> Required Calorie Intake (for those maintaining their current body weight),
   -> Calorie Surplus (for those aiming to gain weight).
2. Exercise Suggestions
   -> The program suggests ideal exercises tailored to the user's parameters, taking into account their goals (weight
      loss, muscle building, general fitness improvement) and fitness level.
3. Data Storage
   All results, including calculated calorie values and recommended exercises, are saved in a text file with the user's
   name, making it easy to access the results in the future.

   
How the program works:

The user enters their data, such as age, weight, height, gender, physical activity level, and goal (e.g., weight loss, 
maintaining weight, muscle gain). The program processes this information and calculates the optimal amount of calories 
to consume, along with a set of exercises. All data is saved in a text file named after the user's first and last name.
